question = value in the particular index at the given row and column formula is = r-1
                                                                                     (c)
                                                                                       c-1
   where r is row and c is column .
   another question = value for the whole particular row 
   calculating the value ncr for every index of the row is o(n^2) so the sortcut is 
   for(int i = 0 ; i < k ; ++i){
   res *=(n-1) ;
   res /= (i+1) ;
   }
